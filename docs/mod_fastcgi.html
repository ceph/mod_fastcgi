        </H1>
        <P>
            This 3<SUP>rd</SUP> party module provides support for the FastCGI protocol. FastCGI is a language
            independent, scalable, open extension to CGI that provides high performance and persistence without the
            limitations of server specific APIs.
        </P>
        <P>
            FastCGI applications are not limited to a particular development language (the protocol is open). FastCGI
            application libraries currently exist for Perl, C/C++, Java, Python, TCL, SmallEiffel, and Smalltalk.
        </P>
        <P>
            FastCGI applications use TCP or Unix sockets to communicate with the web server. This scalable architecture
            allows applications to run on the same platform as the web server or on many machines scattered across an
            enterprise network.
        </P>
        <P>
            FastCGI applications are portable to other web server platforms. FastCGI is supported either directly or
            through commercial extensions by most popular web servers.
        </P>
        <P>
            FastCGI applications are fast because they&#39;re persistent. There is no per-request startup and
            initialization overhead. This makes possible the development of applications which would otherwise be
            impractical within the CGI paradigm (e.g. a huge Perl script, or an application which requires a connection
            to one or more databases).
        </P>
        <P>

            Summary
        </H2>
        <P>
            For information about building and installing the module, see the <A HREF="../INSTALL">INSTALL</A> document
            that came with the distribution.
        </P>
        <P>
            FastCGI applications under <CODE>mod_fastcgi</CODE> are defined as one of three types: static, dynamic, or
            external. They&#39;re configured using the <A HREF="#fastcgiserver">FastCgiServer</A>, <A HREF=
            "#FastCgiConfig">FastCgiConfig</A>, and <A HREF="#FastCgiExternalServer">FastCgiExternalServer</A> <A HREF=
            "#directives">directives</A> respectively. Any URI that Apache identifies as a FastCGI application and
            which hasn&#39;t been explicitly configured using a <A HREF="#fastcgiserver">FastCgiServer</A> or <A HREF=
            "#FastCgiExternalServer">FastCgiExternalServer</A> directive is handled as a dynamic application (see the
            <A HREF="#FastCgiConfig">FastCgiConfig</A> directive for more information).
        </P>
        <P>
            FastCGI static and dynamic applications are spawned and managed by the FastCGI Process Manager, fcgi-pm.
            The process manager is spawned by Apache at server initialization. External applications are presumed to be
            started and managed independently.
        </P>
        <P>
            Apache must be configured to identify requests for FastCGI URIs. <CODE>mod_fastcgi</CODE> registers (with
            Apache) a handler type of <CODE>fastcgi-script</CODE> for this purpose.
        </P>
        <P>
            To configure Apache to handle all files (within the scope of the directive) as FastCGI applications (e.g.
            for a fcgi-bin directory):

            Dynamic FastCGI applications require the <CODE>ExecCGI</CODE> option be enabled (see the <A HREF=

        </H2>
        <P>
            <CODE>mod_fastcgi</CODE> logs FastCGI application error (stderr) output to the server log associated with
            the request. Errors reported by the FastCGI process manager, fcgi-pm, are reported to the main server log
            (typically, logs/error_log). Data written to stdout or stderr before entering the FastCGI <EM>accept</EM>
            loop or via a mechanism that is not FastCGI protocol aware will also be directed to the main server log. If
            Apache&#39;s <A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#loglevel"><CODE>LogLevel</CODE></A> is set
            to <CODE>info</CODE> additional informational messages are printed to the logs, these messages may be
            especially helpful while debugging a configuration.
        </P>
        <P>
            Under Unix, expect your FastCGI application to see SIGPIPE, SIGUSR1, and SIGTERM. The latest FastCGI C, C++
            and Perl application library installs default handlers if none are installed by the application. If an http
            client aborts a request before it completes, mod_fastcgi does too - this results in a SIGPIPE to the
            FastCGI application. At a minimum, SIGPIPE should be ignored (applications spawned by mod_fastcgi have this
            setup automatically). Ideally, it should result in an early abort of the request handling within your
            application and a return to the top of the FastCGI accept() loop. Apache uses SIGUSR1 to request a
            &quot;graceful&quot; process restart/shutdown. It is sent to Apache&#39;s process group (which includes
            applications spawned by mod_fastcgi). Ideally, it should result in a FastCGI application finishing the
            current request, if any, and then an exit. The mod_fastcgi process manager isn&#39;t particularly patient
            though (there&#39;s room for improvement here) and since it has to shutdown too, sends a SIGTERM to all of
            the FastCGI applications it is responsible for. Apache will restart the process manager and it will restart
            its managed applications (as if the server was just started). SIGTERM is, well, SIGTERM - your application
            should exit quickly.
        </P>
        <P>
            Under Windows, there are no signals. A shutdown event is used instead. This is setup by mod_fastcgi and
            honored by the latest version of the C, C++, and Perl application library. If your using a library which
            doesn&#39;t support this, your application will not get shutdown during an Apache restart/shutdown
            (there&#39;s room for improvement here).
        </P>
        <P>
            To pass per-request environment variables to FastCGI applications, have a look at: <A HREF=
            "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_env.html"><CODE>mod_env</CODE></A> (<CODE>SetEnv</CODE>,
            <CODE>PassEnv</CODE>, <CODE>UnSetEnv</CODE>), <A HREF=

            (<CODE>BrowserMatch</CODE>, <CODE>BrowserMatchNoCase</CODE>, <CODE>SetEnvIf</CODE>,
            <CODE>SetEnvIfNoCase</CODE>), and <A HREF=
            "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html"><CODE>mod_rewrite</CODE></A> (if you&#39;re feeling
            adventurous).
        </P>
        <P>
            FastCGI application output is buffered by default. This is not the case for CGI scripts (under Apache 1.3).
            To override the default behavior, use the <CODE>-flush</CODE> option (not available for dynamic
            applications). 
        </P>
        <P>
            Redirects are handled similarly to CGI. Location headers with values that begin with &quot;/&quot; are
            treated as internal-redirects; otherwise, they are treated as external redirects (302).
        </P>
        <P>
            Session affinity (as well as distribution) should be achievable outside of <CODE>mod_fastcgi</CODE> using
            <A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html"><CODE>mod_rewrite</CODE></A>. If you get this
            working, please post the details to <A HREF=
            "mailto:fastcgi-developers@fastcgi.com">fastcgi-developers@fastcgi.com</A> so they can be included here.

        <H2>
            FastCGI Specification Compliance
        </H2>
        <P>
            The FastCGI specification is not implemented in its entirety and I&#39;ve deviated a bit as well resulting
            in some Apache specific features.
        </P>
        <P>
            The file descriptors for stdout and stderr are left open. This is prohibited by the specification. I
            can&#39;t see any reason to require that they be closed, and leaving them open prevents FastCGI
            applications which were not completely ported to FastCGI from failing miserably. This does not mean the
            applications shouldn&#39;t be fixed such that this doesn&#39;t occur, but is invaluable when using a
            3<SUP>rd</SUP> party library (without source code) which expects to be able to write to stderr. Anything
            written to stdout or stderr in this manner will be directed to the main server log.
        </P>
        <P>
            The Filter and Log Roles are not supported. The Filter Role has little value in Apache until the output of
            one handler can be piped into another (Apache 2.0 is expected to support this). The Log Role has some
            value, but Apache&#39;s &quot;piped logs&quot; feature is similar (and is even more CPU friendly).
        </P>
        <P>
            The FastCGI protocol supports a feature, described in the specificiation as &quot;multiplexing&quot;, that
            allows a single client-server connection to be simultaneously shared by multiple requests. This is not
            supported. This does *not* prevent FastCGI applications from supporting multiple simultaneous requests over
            independent connections. Of course, the application has to be specifically designed to do so by using a
            threaded or select/poll based server model.
        </P>
        <P>
            The Authorizer Role has three variations corresponding to three specific Apache request handling
            phases:&nbsp; Authentication, Authorization, and Access Control. <CODE>mod_fastcgi</CODE> sets up the
            (Apache specific) environment variable &quot;FCGI_APACHE_ROLE&quot; to indicate which Apache authorizer
            phase is being performed.
        </P>
        <P>
            Authorizers under <CODE>mod_fastcgi</CODE> are sent nearly all of the standard environment variables
            typically available to CGI/FastCGI request handlers including some explicitly precluded by the FastCGI
            specification (for authorizers); I didn&#39;t see the point in leaving them out. All headers returned by a
            FastCGI Authorizer in a successful response (Status: 200) are passed to sub-processes (CGI/FastCGI
            invocations) as environment variables rather than just those prefixed by <CODE>Variable-</CODE> as the
            FastCGI specification calls for; I didn&#39;t see the point in leaving them out either. FastCGI
            specification compliant authorizer behavior can be obtained by using the <CODE>-compat</CODE> option to the
            Auth server directives.
        </P>
        <P>
            Custom failure responses from FastCGI authorizer applications are not supported (speak up if you need
            this). See the <A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#errordocument">ErrorDocument</A>
            directive for a workaround (a CGI/FastCGI application can serve the error document).

            The <CODE>FastCgiConfig</CODE> directive defines the default parameters for <EM>all</EM> dynamic FastCGI

            Dynamic applications are not started at server initialization, but upon demand. If the demand is heavy,
            additional application instances are started. As the demand fades, application instances are killed off.
            Many of the options govern this process.

                <STRONG>Unix:&nbsp;</STRONG> The number of seconds to wait for a connection to the FastCGI application
                to complete or 0 to indicate a blocking <CODE>connect()</CODE> should be used. Blocking
                <CODE>connect()</CODE>s have an OS dependent internal timeout. If the timeout expires, a SERVER_ERROR
                results. For non-zero values, this is the amount of time used in a <CODE>select()</CODE> to write to
                the file descriptor returned by a non-blocking <CODE>connect()</CODE>. Non-blocking
                <CODE>connect()</CODE>s are troublesome on many platforms. See also <CODE>-idle-timeout</CODE>, it
                produces similar results but in a more portable manner.<BR>
                 <STRONG>Windows NT:&nbsp;</STRONG> TCP based applications work as above. Named pipe based applications
                (static applications configured without the <CODE>-port</CODE> option and dynamic applications) use
                this value successfully to limit the amount of time to wait for a connection (i.e. it&#39;s not
                &quot;troublesome&quot;). By default, this is 90 seconds (FCGI_NAMED_PIPE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT in

                instances of the application are killed off. In general, it&#39;s preferred that this type of
                functionality be built-in to the application (e.g. every 100th request it checks to see if there&#39;s
                a newer version on disk and exits if so). There may be an outstanding problem (bug) when this option is

            not have to exist in the local filesystem. URIs that Apache resolves to this <EM>filename</EM> will be

            External FastCGI applications are not started by the process manager, they are presumed to be started and
            managed &quot;external&quot; to Apache and mod_fastcgi. The FastCGI devkit provides a simple tool,
            <CODE>cgi-fcgi</CODE>, for starting FastCGI applications independent of the server (applications can also
            be <EM>self-starting</EM>, see the devkit).

            slash (/) then it is assumed to be relative to the <A HREF=
            "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#serverroot">ServerRoot</A>. The wrapper is used to invoke all
            FastCGI applications (in the future this directive will have directory context).
        </P>
        <P>
            When <CODE>FastCgiWrapper</CODE> is enabled, no assumptions are made about the target application and thus
            presence and permissions checks cannot be made. This is the responsibility of the wrapper.
        </P>
        <P>
            The wrapper is invoked with the following arguments: username, group, application. The username and group
            are determined as described below. The application is the &quot;filename&quot; Apache resolves the
            requested URI to (dynamic) or the filename provided as an argument to another FastCGI (server or
            authorizer) directive. These arguments may or may not be used by the wrapper (e.g. suexec uses them,
            cgiwrap parses the URI and ignores them). The environment passed to the wrapper is identical to the
            environment passed when a wrapper is not in use.
        </P>
        <P>
            When <CODE>FastCgiWrapper</CODE> is enabled, the location of static or external FastCGI application
            directives can be important. Under Apache 1.3, they inherit their user and group from the <CODE>user and
            group</CODE> of the virtual server in which they are defined. <CODE><A HREF=
            "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#user">User</A></CODE> and <CODE><A HREF=
            "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#group">Group</A></CODE> directives <I><U>must</U></I> precede
            FastCGI application definitions. Under Apache 2.0, the <CODE>-user</CODE> and <CODE>-group</CODE> options
            to <A HREF="#FastCgiServer">FastCgiServer</A> and <A HREF=
            "#FastCgiExternalServer">FastCgiExternalServer</A> directives must be used (dynamic applications still use
            the virtual server&#39;s user and group).
        </P>
        <P>
            Note that access to (use of) FastCGI applications is <U><I>not</I></U> limited to the virtual server in
            which they were defined. The application is used to service requests from any virtual server with the same
            user and group.
        </P>
        <P>
            If a request is received for a FastCGI application without an existing matching definition already running
            with the correct user and group, a dynamic instance of the application is started with the correct user and
            group. This can lead to multiple copies of the same application running with different user/group. If this
            is a problem, preclude navigation to the application from other virtual servers or configure the virtual
            servers with the same User and Group.
        </P>
        <P>
            See the Apache documentation for more information about suexec (make sure you fully understand the security
            implications).

        <P>
            <CODE>mod_fastcgi</CODE> sends nearly all of the standard environment variables typically available to
            CGI/FastCGI request handlers. All headers returned by a FastCGI access-checker application in a successful
            response (Status: 200) are passed to sub-processes (CGI/FastCGI invocations) as environment variables. All
            headers returned in an unsuccessful response are passed on to the client. FastCGI specification compliant
            behavior can be obtained by using the <CODE>-compat</CODE> option.
        </P>
        <P>
            <CODE>mod_fastcgi</CODE> sets the environment variable &quot;FCGI_APACHE_ROLE&quot; to
            &quot;ACCESS_CHECKER&quot; to indicate which (Apache specific) authorizer phase is being performed.
        </P>
        <P>
            Custom failure responses from FastCGI authorizer applications are not (yet?) supported. See the <A HREF=
            "http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#errordocument">ErrorDocument</A> directive for a workaround (a
            FastCGI application can serve the document).

        <P>
            Setting the <CODE>FastCgiAccessCheckerAuthoritative</CODE> directive explicitly to <EM>Off</EM> allows
            access checking to be passed on to lower level modules (as defined in the <CODE>Configuration</CODE> and
            <CODE>modules.c</CODE> files) if the FastCGI application fails to allow access.
        </P>
        <P>
            By default, control is not passed on and a failed access check will result in a Forbidden reply. Disabling
            the default should be carefully considered.
