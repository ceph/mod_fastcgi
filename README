README for mod_fastcgi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mod_fastcgi is a module for the Apache web server, that enables
FastCGI - a standards based protocol for communicating with
applications that generate dynamic content for web pages.

FastCGI provides a superset of CGI functionality, but a subset of the
functionality of programming for a particular web server API.
Nonetheless, the feature set is rich enough for programming virtually
any type of web application, but the result is generally more
scalable.  For more information on FastCGI, see

For information on installing mod_fastcgi with Apache 1.3.x, see the
file INSTALL.

For information on installing mod_fastcgi with Apache 2.x, see the
